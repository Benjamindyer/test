# NICEIC × Powered Now Affiliate Partnership Proposal

**February 2026 - Confidential**

## 1\. Executive Summary

The **Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax** deadline of April 2026 creates an urgent need for NICEIC's 38,000 members to adopt compliant digital record-keeping software. Sole traders and landlords with total sales over £50,000 must transition from spreadsheets to MTD-compatible systems. This presents both a compliance challenge and a revenue opportunity for NICEIC.

**Powered Now** is the UK's leading job management software, purpose-built for trade businesses, offering seamless MTD compliance. It is the only known solution offering native support for MTD IT. This proposal outlines an exclusive partnership where NICEIC recommends Powered Now to members with an offer of '3 months for the price of 1', while NICEIC earns a recurring commission of 20–25% of gross margin on every referral, for the lifetime of each customer.

## 2\. The Opportunity: Why Now?

### 2.1 Making Tax Digital for Income Tax

-   **April 2026**: Sole traders and landlords with total sales over £50,000 must use MTD-compatible software for quarterly digital submissions to HMRC.
    
-   **April 2027**: Threshold drops to £30,000.
    
-   **April 2028**: Threshold drops to £20,000.
    

Approximately 780,000 sole traders will be affected from April 2026, with a further 970,000 affected from April 2027. A points-based penalty regime will be introduced. There is a significant awareness gap, with only 27% aware of MTD and 23% ready for the change.

### 2.2 The NICEIC Member Opportunity

-   38,000 NICEIC-certified businesses, predominantly electrical contractors.
    
-   Sole traders impacted are typically least computerized and have low administrative capacity.
    
-   Many use paper records or generic accounting software.
    
-   An exclusive NICEIC-endorsed solution adds genuine, tangible member value.

## 6\. How It Works

### 6.1 Roles and Responsibilities

| Powered Now | NICEIC |
| --- | --- |
| Sell and market to NICEIC members | Promote via member communications |
| Onboard with free setup + training | Endorse as recommended solution |
| Provide ongoing customer support | Include in training events and webinars |
| Build co-branded landing page | Promote and support member uptake |
| Provide reporting dashboard | Share member feedback for improvement |

### 6.2 Proposed Timeline

-   **February–March 2026**: Agreement negotiation and finalization
    
-   **March 2026**: Build landing page and tracking system
    
-   **April 2026**: Soft launch to pilot group
    
-   **May–June 2026**: Full launch to all NICEIC members
    
-   **Ongoing**: Quarterly business reviews, joint webinars
    

## Risk Mitigation

-   **Low member awareness of MTD**: Joint awareness campaign; NICEIC endorsement.
    
-   **Members using other software**: Emphasize exclusive deal, trade-specific features.
    
-   **Support capacity during launch**: Pre-resource support; stagger rollout by region.
    
-   **Low NICEIC promotion**: Commission tied to promotion commitment; quarterly reviews.
    
-   **Churn after promotional period**: Strong product quality for retention.
    

## 8\. Next Steps

1.  Review this proposal and financial model.
    
2.  Schedule a call to discuss terms and agree on the commission rate.
    
3.  Sign the partnership agreement by March 2026.
    
4.  Begin co-branded landing page and tracking system build.
    
5.  Launch to members by April 2026.
    

Every month of delay is a lost opportunity. Making Tax Digital for Income Tax comes into effect in April 2026.
