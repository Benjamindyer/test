NICEIC × Powered Now Affiliate Partnership Proposal February 2026 Confidential 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax deadline of April 2026 creates an urgent and immediate need for NICEIC's c.38,000 members to adopt compliant digital record-keeping software. Sole traders and landlords with total sales over £50,000 must transition from spreadsheets to MTD-compatible systems within weeks. This represents both a critical compliance challenge and a significant revenue opportunity for NICEIC. Powered Now is the UK's leading job management software purpose-built for trade businesses, seamless MTD compliance, and trusted by thousands of UK tradespeople. Powered Now is the only known job management solution that will offer native support for MTD IT. All others require an expensive accounting system focused on accounting and giving little value to small electrical businesses. This proposal outlines an exclusive partnership: NICEIC recommends Powered Now to members with a compelling exclusive offer ' 3 months for the price of 1' while NICEIC earns recurring commission of 20–25% of gross margin on every referral, for the lifetime of each customer. This represents a low-effort, high-value recurring revenue stream for NICEIC that simultaneously solves a real, pressing compliance problem for members. This partnership delivers genuine value to all parties within months. 2. THE OPPORTUNITY: WHY NOW? 2.1 Making Tax Digital for Income Tax ● April 2026: Sole traders and landlords with total sales (not profit) over £50,000 must use MTD-compatible software for quarterly digital submissions to HMRC. Anyone using spreadsheets for their records will need to upgrade. April 2027: Threshold drops to £30,000; April 2028: drops to £20,000

Approximately 780,000 sole traders will be affected from April 2026, with a further 970,000 affected from April 2027. A new points-based penalty regime will be introduced and the Government has confirmed there will be no further delays. There is a significant awareness gap among tradespeople regarding MTD requirements and deadlines with a recent Powered Now survey (c.150 trades companies surveyed) demonstrating that only 27% knew about MTD and 23% are ready for the change. 2.2 The NICEIC Member Opportunity ● 38,000 NICEIC-certified businesses, predominantly electrical contractors ● Sole traders are the people impacted, but these are typically the least computerised and the ones with the lowest administrative capacity ● Many currently using paper records, spreadsheets, or generic accounting software ● An exclusive NICEIC-endorsed solution adds genuine, tangible member value 3. ABOUT POWERED NOW UK's #1 job management software for trade businesses ● Invoicing, quoting, scheduling ● Digital forms and certificates (including electrical EICRs, PAT testing) ● Expense tracking, team management, HR ● Customer portal and automated workflows ● MTD for VAT compliant; MTD for IT compliance in development as reported by HMRC ● Works on iOS, Android, Mac, PC, and web. Works offline. ● UK-based support team noted for its care for customers and with a 4.5-star Trustpilot rating ● Free personalised setup and training included ● Already trusted by thousands of UK tradespeople 4. THE EXCLUSIVE NICEIC MEMBER OFFER To drive adoption and embed Powered Now within the NICEIC member community, we propose a time-limited exclusive offer: Feature Standard (Direct) vs NICEIC Exclusive Setup Self-service or paid setup Free personalised setup—account configured, contacts imported, branding applied

COMMERCIAL TERMS 5.1 Commission Structure ● Basis: Percentage of gross margin (revenue minus direct costs of delivery) ● Rate: 20% of gross margin for the first 500 users, increasing to 25% ● Timing: No commission during free promotional months (months 2–3); commission earned from month 1 (paid month) and then month 4 onwards ● Payment: Quarterly in arrears when a minimum threshold of £1000 has been met ● Tracking: Unique NICEIC referral code and co-branded landing page with full reporting dashboard 5.2 Illustrative Economics Per-User Economics (Professional Plan at £32/user/month): Period Revenue Gross Margin Commission @ 20% Month 1 £32 £20.80 £4.16 Months 2–3 Free Free £0 Month 4+ £32/month £20.80/month £4.16/month Year 1 Total £128 £83 £42

Portfolio-Level Projections (2% conversion of 38,000 members = 760 businesses, averaging 2 users per business): Period Commission @ 20% Commission @ 25% Year 1 ~£63,000 ~£79,000 Year 2 ~£65,000 ~£81,000 Cumulative (Yr 1–2) ~£128,000 ~£160,000 We can build a separate financial model if required. 6. HOW IT WORKS 6.1 Roles and Responsibilities Powered Now NICEIC ● Sell and market to NICEIC members ● Onboard with free setup + training ● Provide ongoing customer support ● Build co-branded landing page + tracking system ● Provide reporting dashboard for performance monitoring ● Maintain MTD compliance and electrical features ● Create marketing materials and assets ● Promote via member communications (email, website, portal, renewal packs, banner in Nocs) ● Endorse as recommended solution ● Include in training events and webinars ● Refer member enquiries and support uptake ● Share member feedback for product improvement ● Support quarterly business reviews 6.2 Proposed Timeline ● February–March 2026: Agreement negotiation and finalisation ● March 2026: Build landing page, tracking system, and onboarding flow ● April 2026: Soft launch to pilot group (coincides with MTD go-live for >£50k earners) ● May–June 2026: Full launch to all NICEIC members ● Ongoing: Quarterly business reviews, joint webinars, continuous optimisation

7.  RISK MITIGATION Risk Mitigation Low member awareness of MTD Joint awareness campaign; MTD is the primary driver, not the software. NICEIC endorsement provides credibility. Members already using other software Emphasise exclusive deal value, trade-specific features, free migration support. Free 3-month trial reduces switching risk. Support capacity during launch Pre-resource support team; stagger rollout by region if needed; proven onboarding process and playbook. Low active promotion by NICEIC Commission rate tied to promotion commitment; quarterly reviews with conversion targets and KPIs. Churn after promotional period Deep embedding through free setup, training, and genuine 3-month usage before first renewal decision. Strong product quality ensures retention. 8. NEXT STEPS 1. Review this proposal and the accompanying financial model 2. Schedule a call to discuss terms and agree on final commission rate 3. Sign partnership agreement (target: March 2026) 4. Begin co-branded landing page and tracking system build 5. Launch to members (target: April 2026) Every month of delay is lost opportunity. Making Tax Digital for Income Tax comes into effect in April 2026.
