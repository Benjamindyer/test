NICEIC × Powered Now Affiliate Partnership Proposal February 2026 | Confidential

Executive Summary The Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax deadline of April 2026 creates an urgent and immediate need for NICEIC's c. 38 , 000 registered businesses to adopt compliant digital record-keeping software. Electricians with total sales over £ 50 , 000 must transition from spreadsheets to MTD-compatible systems within weeks. This represents both a critical compliance challenge and a significant revenue opportunity for NICEIC. Powered Now is the UK's leading job management software purpose-built for trade businesses, with MTD compliance built-in, and trusted by thousands of UK tradespeople. Powered Now is the only known job management solution that will offer native support for MTD IT. All others require an expensive accounting system focused on accounting and giving little value to small electrical businesses. This proposal outlines an exclusive partnership: NICEIC recommends Powered Now to its registered businesses with a compelling exclusive offer — half price on the top Powered Now tier for six months: £ 20 per user for six months on the Premium Plan — everything you need to run your business including: Making Tax Digital Ready — no need for complicated accounting software Free set up and support from our award-winning UK-based support team Schedule your jobs, keep your customers happy Automatic invoice and quote chasing — get paid faster Full Powered Now features, including unlimited AI usage Now including a free website and domain While NICEIC earns recurring commission of 20 – 25 % of gross margin on every referral, for the lifetime of each customer. For NICEIC, this is a recurring revenue stream that requires very little effort to maintain while solving an urgent compliance problem for registered businesses.

The Opportunity: Why Now? Making Tax Digital for Income Tax 01 April 2026 Electricians with total sales (not profit) over £ 50 , 000 must use MTD-compatible software for quarterly digital submissions to HMRC. Anyone using spreadsheets for their records will need to upgrade. 02 April 2027 Threshold drops to £ 30 , 000 . 03 April 2028 Threshold drops to £ 20 , 000 . Approximately 780 , 000 sole traders will be affected from April 2026 , with a further 970 , 000 affected from April 2027 . A new points- based penalty regime will be introduced and the Government has confirmed there will be no further delays. There is a significant awareness gap among tradespeople regarding MTD requirements and deadlines, with a recent Powered Now survey (c. 150 trades companies surveyed) demonstrating that only 27 % knew about MTD and just 23 % are ready for the change . The NICEIC Registered Business Opportunity 38 , 000 NICEIC-registered businesses, predominantly electrical contractors Sole traders are the people most impacted, but these are typically the least computerised and the ones with the lowest administrative capacity Many currently using paper records, spreadsheets, or generic accounting software An exclusive NICEIC-endorsed solution adds genuine, tangible value to registered businesses

Commercial Terms Commission Structure Initial Term: 12 months from the date of execution and then until terminated by either party Basis: Percentage of gross margin (revenue minus direct costs of delivery) Rate: 20 % of gross margin for the first 500 referred users, increasing to 25 % thereafter Timing: Commission earned from month 1 onwards on all revenue (including discounted months) Payment: Quarterly in arrears when a minimum threshold of £ 1 , 000 has been met Tracking: Unique NICEIC referral code and co-branded landing page with full reporting dashboard Termination: Either party may terminate with 3 months' written notice after the initial term. On termination, commission continues to be paid on existing referred customers for 12 months ("tail period"). Illustrative Economics Per-User Economics (Premium Plan): Period Monthly Price Gross Margin ( 65 %) Commission @ 20 % Commission @ 25 % Months 1 3 6 (half price) £ 20 £ 13 . 00 £ 2 . 60 £ 3 . 25 Month 7 onwards (full price) £ 40 £ 26 . 00 £ 5 . 20 £ 6 . 50 Year 1 Total £ 360 £ 234 £ 46 . 80 £ 58 . 50 Year 2 Total (full price) £ 480 £ 312 £ 62 . 40 £ 78 . 00 Portfolio-Level Projections: 5 % conversion of 38 , 000 registered businesses = 1 , 900 businesses, averaging 2 users per business = 3 , 800 users. Assumes 3 % monthly churn. At this volume, NICEIC would reach the 25 % commission tier almost immediately. Period Commission to NICEIC @ 25 % Year 1 (initial cohort) ~£ 183 , 000 Year 2 (initial cohort only) ~£ 175 , 000 These figures reflect the initial referral cohort only. With ongoing NICEIC promotion generating continued new referrals, Year 2 and beyond grow significantly: New purchases Year 2 Commission @ 25 % 50 businesses/month ~£ 221 , 000 75 businesses/month ~£ 243 , 000 100 businesses/month ~£ 266 , 000 Note: Powered Now is focused on growing Monthly R ecurring R evenue (M RR ), however subscribers do have the option to save money by opting for an annual plan. If this is the case, the model will simply reflect a twelfth of the annual plan. This will be clearly illustrated on monthly reports.

How It Works Roles and Responsibilities Powered Now Sell and onboard NICEIC-referred businesses Provide free setup and training for every referral Provide ongoing customer support Build co-branded landing page and tracking system Provide reporting dashboard for performance monitoring Maintain MTD compliance Create marketing materials and assets NICEIC Promote via communications to registered businesses (email, website, portal, renewal packs, banner in NOCs) Endorse as recommended solution Include in training events and webinars Refer enquiries and support uptake Share feedback for product improvement Support quarterly business reviews Proposed Timeline 1 February3March 2026 Agreement negotiation and finalisation 2 March 2026 Build landing page, tracking system, and onboarding flow 3 April 2026 Soft launch to pilot group (coincides with MTD go-live for >£ 50 k earners) 4 May3June 2026 Full launch to all NICEIC-registered businesses 5 Ongoing Quarterly business reviews, joint webinars, continuous optimisation

Risk Mitigation Risk Mitigation Low awareness of MTD among registered businesses Joint awareness campaign; MTD is the primary driver, not the software. NICEIC endorsement provides credibility. Registered businesses already using other software Emphasise exclusive deal value, trade-specific features, free migration support. Six-month half-price period reduces switching risk. Support capacity during launch Pre-resource support team; stagger rollout by region if needed; proven onboarding process and playbook. Low active promotion by NICEIC Commission rate tied to promotion commitment; quarterly reviews with conversion targets and KPIs. Churn after promotional period By the time the half-price period ends, registered businesses will have been using the software daily for six months with proper setup and training — that's a hard habit to break.

Extension: White-Label Partnership The Opportunity Beyond the affiliate partnership described above, Powered Now is prepared to offer NICEIC the option to extend this relationship into a full white-label partnership. Under a white-label arrangement, Powered Now's software would be fully rebranded as an NICEIC product, for example, "NICEIC Business Manager" or a name of NICEIC's choosing, giving NICEIC a proprietary software offering for its registered businesses. This would give NICEIC its own digital product 4 a new recurring revenue stream that grows with the register. What White-Label Includes Feature Description Full NICEIC Branding Software rebranded with NICEIC logo, colours, and identity throughout the application, app stores, and web Custom Domain Hosted on an NICEIC-owned domain (e.g., software.niceic.com or business.niceic.com) App Store Presence Published under the NICEIC brand in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store Tailored Feature Set Features prioritised and configured specifically for NICEIC's registered businesses Dedicated Onboarding Premium onboarding experience branded as an NICEIC service Co-developed Roadmap Joint product roadmap with NICEIC input on feature priorities, particularly around electrical compliance, regulatory changes, and integration with NICEIC's own systems NICEIC Support Tier Option for first-line support to be handled by NICEIC (with Powered Now providing second-line and technical support), or fully managed by Powered Now under NICEIC branding Commercial Model for White-Label The white-label commercial terms would differ from the affiliate model and would be subject to separate negotiation. Strategic Value for NICEIC A white-label software product would position NICEIC as more than a certification body - it would become a complete business services partner for electrical contractors. Key strategic benefits include: New recurring revenue stream Software subscriptions provide predictable monthly revenue, diversifying NICEIC's income beyond certification fees Deeper registered business engagement Daily software use creates a much stickier relationship than annual certification alone Data and insights Aggregated, anonymised usage data provides NICEIC with valuable market intelligence on the electrical contracting sector Competitive differentiation No other UK certification body offers a proprietary, trade-specific job management platform Upsell and cross-sell opportunities The software creates a digital channel to promote NICEIC training, insurance, and other services to registered businesses

Next Steps 01 Review this proposal 02 Schedule a call to discuss terms and agree on final commission rate 03 Sign partnership agreement (target: March 2026 ) 04 Begin co-branded landing page and tracking system build 05 Launch to NICEIC-registered businesses (target: April 2026 ) 06 Review white-label extension at 6 -month partnership review Every month of delay is lost opportunity. Making Tax Digital for Income Tax comes into effect in April 2026 .
